# Sanchari's Bio - Final Version for Review

## Full Bio (For BookBot Website)

My name is Sanchari, and I'm doing my PhD with BookBot to understand how AI can help every child become a confident reader—especially those who struggle. As a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist, I get to combine what fascinates me most: how the brain learns to read, and how technology can support children who find reading challenging.

Before joining BookBot, I worked with brain imaging research in Europe, supported children with learning disabilities at one of India's largest EdTech companies, and conducted neuropsychological assessments with kids facing reading difficulties. These experiences taught me that the science of reading only matters if it translates into real help for real children. The gap between research labs and living rooms is what I'm here to close.

What makes my work at BookBot so exciting is that we're not just building technology—we're co-designing it with the children who use it. I analyze reading patterns from thousands of kids to understand what keeps them engaged and helps them grow. But more importantly, we're working directly with children and families to shape how our AI responds to their needs. This means our technology isn't just smart; it's genuinely helpful for kids at different ages and reading levels.

My job is to translate between two worlds: the research on reading development and what actually works in your home or classroom. I write about what we're discovering in ways that feel less like a textbook and more like a conversation with someone who genuinely cares about your child's reading journey. Whether your child is racing ahead or needs extra support, I want to help you understand how to nurture their growth.
