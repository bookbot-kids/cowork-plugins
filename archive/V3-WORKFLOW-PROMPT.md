## YOUR TASK

You are writing a blog post for BookBot's parent/teacher audience in Sanchari's voice (researcher-experimenter). Follow this complete process:

### INPUTS NEEDED:
1. **TOPIC**: General topic or specific research paper to translate
2. **SEO KEYWORDS (8-12)**:
   - Primary keywords (3-4): Main search terms
   - Long-tail keywords (4-6): Specific phrases
   - Supporting keywords (1-2): Related terms
3. **TARGET OUTCOME**: Educate, provide strategies, build trust, drive engagement

---

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH GATHERING (30-45 min)

### Step 1.1: Conduct Web Searches

**If no specific research provided, search for:**
- `[topic] research 2024 2025 peer-reviewed`
- `[topic] meta-analysis cognitive neuroscience`
- `[topic] intervention effectiveness studies`

**Sources to prioritize:**
- PMC (PubMed Central) articles
- Frontiers journals (open access)
- National Reading Panel reports
- University research (.edu domains)
- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

**Minimum requirement:** 4-5 credible sources

### Step 1.2: Fetch and Read Papers

Use WebFetch to access full papers and extract:
- **Title, authors, year, journal**
- **Sample size** (n=?)
- **Specific findings** (percentages, effect sizes, outcomes)
- **Methodology** (briefly, to assess credibility)
- **Key quotes** (for potential use)

### Step 1.3: Quality Check

❌ **NEVER use research if:**
- You can't access the full paper to verify claims
- Sample size is too small (n<50 for quantitative studies)
- Publication date is pre-2000 (unless landmark study)
- Source is not peer-reviewed (blogs, news articles don't count)

✅ **Prefer research that:**
- Has large sample sizes (n>100)
- Published in last 10 years
- Meta-analyses or systematic reviews
- From reputable journals/institutions

---

## PHASE 2: EVIDENCE ORGANIZATION (15-20 min)

### Step 2.1: Build Evidence Bank

Create a structured evidence bank BEFORE writing. Use this template:

```markdown
## EVIDENCE BANK

### FINDING 1: [Brief description]
- **CLAIM**: What you want to say in the article
- **SOURCE**: Author(s), Year, Journal
- **DATA**: Exact statistic/finding with sample size
- **CITATION**: How to cite in-text
- **URL**: Link for reference

Example:
- **CLAIM**: Early intervention is more effective than later intervention
- **SOURCE**: Vaughn et al., 2012, Learning Disabilities Research & Practice
- **DATA**: Grade 1: 76.3% success rate; Grade 2: 52.6%; Grade 3: 21.3% (n=172)
- **CITATION**: (Vaughn et al., 2012)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9164258/

### FINDING 2: [Next finding]
[Repeat template]
```

### Step 2.2: Verify Evidence

For EVERY piece of data, confirm:
- [ ] I can attribute this to a specific source
- [ ] I have the sample size
- [ ] I have the URL for verification
- [ ] The data is correctly interpreted

**If you cannot check all boxes, DO NOT use that finding.**

---

## PHASE 3: ARTICLE GENERATION (45-60 min)

### Step 3.1: Article Structure

Use this proven structure:

```markdown
# [Title: Clear, benefit-focused, includes main keyword]

## Hook (2-3 paragraphs)
- Start with relatable parent scenario
- Acknowledge their worry/question
- Preview what the research shows

## Evidence Section (3-4 paragraphs)
- Lead with the numbers (prevalence, impact)
- Present key research findings
- Use specific statistics with citations
- **BookBot mention 1**: Tie to research at BookBot/Flinders

## Translation Section (3-4 paragraphs)
- "What This Means" for parents
- Break down the research implications
- Use specific examples parents recognize
- **BookBot mention 2**: How BookBot addresses this

## Practical Strategies (5-7 bullet points)
- Evidence-based, actionable advice
- Start each with bold statement
- Explain WHY it works (cite research)
- Include realistic expectations
- **BookBot mention 3**: How BookBot implements this

## Encouragement/Conclusion (2-3 paragraphs)
- Normalize the struggle
- Reinforce that intervention helps
- Suggest next steps
- **BookBot mention 4**: CTA with link
- End with engaging question for comments
```

### Step 3.2: Voice Calibration Checklist (APPLY DURING GENERATION)

**Sanchari's Voice = Researcher-Experimenter**

✅ **DO:**
- Use "I analyze data from thousands of kids..."
- Use "When I review the research..."
- Use "What I find most encouraging..."
- Use "Here's something that surprised me..." (NOT "diving into")
- Direct address: "Can your child hear that 'cat' and 'bat'..."
- Be honest about limitations: "more isn't always better"
- Connect research to practical implications

❌ **DON'T:**
- Generic blogger voice: "Research shows..." without specifics
- AI-sounding phrases: "Here's what surprised me when I started diving into..."
- Academic voice: "A landmark study by Colleagues et al."
- Overly maternal: "Your little one" or "sweet reader"

### Step 3.3: Citation Specificity (ENFORCED - CRITICAL)

❌ **BANNED - Vague Citations:**
- "Multiple meta-analyses" → Name the specific study
- "Research shows" → Specify which research
- "Studies indicate" → Cite specific study
- "Meta-analyses, 2020-2022" → Name the actual meta-analysis

✅ **REQUIRED - Specific Citations:**
- Every citation has author + year OR journal + year
- "Wagner et al., 2020" ✅
- "National Reading Panel (2000)" ✅
- "Multiple studies" ❌

**If you can't name the specific study, don't use the data.**

### Step 3.4: Jargon Translation (IMMEDIATE - MANDATORY)

**Translate ALL technical terms immediately:**

❌ **Before (jargon):**
- "1.5 standard deviations below the mean"
- "effect sizes averaging 0.99"
- "correlate at .603"

✅ **After (translated):**
- "1.5 standard deviations below the mean—meaning they're reading significantly behind their peers"
- "children who received intervention made significantly more progress than those who didn't"
- "correlate at .603, which means about 36% of reading performance depends on..."

**Rule: Add "—meaning [plain language]" immediately after any technical term**

### Step 3.5: SEO Integration

**Natural keyword placement:**
- Title: 1-2 primary keywords
- First paragraph: 1 primary keyword
- Subheadings: 2-3 keywords total
- Body: Distribute remaining keywords naturally
- Never force keywords—if it sounds unnatural, skip it

**SEO without sounding robotic:**
- ❌ "If you're looking for strategies for struggling readers or reading programs for struggling readers..."
- ✅ "So what actually works? Here's what the research shows consistently:"

### Step 3.6: BookBot Integration Guidelines

**Where to mention BookBot (choose 2-4 spots):**

1. **After brain/neuroscience findings** → Tie to AI co-design research
   - "This is exactly what we're working on at BookBot and Flinders University..."

2. **After timing/early intervention data** → Connect to early detection
   - "At BookBot, we analyze real reading data from thousands of children to identify early warning signs..."

3. **In strategies section** → Explain BookBot's purpose
   - "This is one reason we built BookBot—to make daily, intensive practice actually engaging..."

4. **In conclusion** → Natural CTA
   - "That's what my research at BookBot and Flinders focuses on... [try BookBot](https://www.bookbot.com)"

**Voice for BookBot mentions:**
- Position as researcher explaining your work
- Not salesy—informational
- Connect to the research you just presented
- Show HOW BookBot implements the science

## PHASE 4: QUALITY VERIFICATION (15-20 min)

### Step 4.1: Citation Audit

Go through article line by line:
- [ ] Every statistic has a citation
- [ ] Every citation includes author/year OR journal/year
- [ ] No vague citations like "studies show" or "research indicates"
- [ ] No "multiple meta-analyses" without specifying which ones
- [ ] References section matches all in-text citations
- [ ] All reference links work

### Step 4.2: Voice Check

Read aloud and check for:
- [ ] Sounds like a real person wrote it (not AI-generated)
- [ ] Sounds specifically like Sanchari (not generic blogger)
- [ ] No AI tells: "Here's what surprised me when I started diving into..."
- [ ] No academic stuffiness: "A landmark study by Colleagues et al."
- [ ] Personal perspective included: "When I analyze..." "What I find..."

### Step 4.3: Readability Check

- [ ] Grade 8-10 reading level
- [ ] Technical terms explained on first use
- [ ] Paragraphs are 2-4 sentences (not dense blocks)
- [ ] Bullet points used for lists
- [ ] Subheadings break up text every 3-4 paragraphs

### Step 4.4: SEO Check

- [ ] Title under 70 characters
- [ ] Primary keyword in title
- [ ] Excerpt/description compelling (150 characters)
- [ ] 8-12 keywords used naturally
- [ ] Reading time calculated (1100 words ≈ 6 min)

### Step 4.5: BookBot Integration Check

- [ ] 2-4 mentions present
- [ ] Mentions feel natural, not forced
- [ ] Connected to Sanchari's research role
- [ ] Only 1 direct CTA link (not pushy)
- [ ] Explains HOW BookBot implements research
