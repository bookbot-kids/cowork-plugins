# Should My Child Use AI for Homework? What Parents Need to Know

Your child sits at the kitchen table, ChatGPT open on their laptop, asking AI to check their essay. Or maybe they're using an AI tutoring app you downloaded, hoping it will help with math. You've noticed they reach for these AI learning apps for kids constantly—and you're wondering: Is this actually helping them learn, or are they becoming too dependent?

If you're asking "should my child use AI for homework," you're not alone. When I review the research on AI in education at BookBot and Flinders University, I see this question from parents constantly. The answer isn't simple—and it might surprise you. The latest studies show that some AI tools genuinely accelerate learning, while others can actually harm your child's critical thinking abilities. The difference comes down to how the AI is designed and how students use it.

## The Evidence: AI's Impact Is More Complex Than You Think

Here's what caught my attention in the recent research: AI in education isn't inherently good or bad. The outcomes depend entirely on implementation.

A 2025 study by Hansen and colleagues examined what happens when students use an AI feedback coach while giving peer feedback. The results were concerning: students who used the AI coach provided fewer thoughtful questions, wrote shorter responses, and relied on the AI's validation rather than their own judgment (Hansen et al., 2025). In other words, the AI tool made their feedback worse, not better.

But that's only part of the story. A Harvard study with 194 physics students found something very different. When researchers designed an AI tutor specifically for learning (not just answering questions), students using it learned twice as much as those in traditional active-learning classrooms—and they did it in less time. The AI group's median test scores jumped to 4.5 compared to 3.5 for in-class students, a difference so significant that statisticians would call it highly unlikely to happen by chance (p < 10⁻⁸)—meaning the result is extremely reliable. They also completed the work in 49 minutes versus 60 minutes (Kestin et al., 2025).

How can AI both harm and help learning? The key is in the details. A comprehensive analysis of 41 studies involving 4,813 students found that, on average, AI-generated feedback performs about the same as human feedback (Meta-analysis, 2025). But "on average" hides important variation—some AI tools dramatically outperform teachers, while others underperform.

## What This Means for Your Child

When I analyze data from thousands of kids using educational technology, including at BookBot, I see a clear pattern: how your child uses AI matters more than whether they use it.

The concerning findings from Zhai and colleagues' systematic review reveal the real risk. Students who regularly rely on AI dialogue systems for homework show diminished decision-making abilities, weaker critical thinking, and reduced analytical reasoning (Zhai et al., 2024). This isn't about AI being inherently harmful—it's about cognitive offloading, which means letting the AI do the thinking instead of using it as a tool to support their own thinking.

Here's a concrete example: If your 5th grader asks ChatGPT, "What should I write for my book report?" and copies the response, they're offloading the cognitive work. Their brain isn't practicing the valuable skills of organizing ideas, choosing what's important, or constructing an argument. But if they ask, "Can you help me understand what the author's main message was in this chapter?" and then write their own analysis, the AI is supporting their thinking, not replacing it.

The Harvard study provides another important insight: students using the well-designed AI tutor reported feeling significantly more engaged (4.1 out of 5) compared to traditional classroom learning (3.6 out of 5) (Kestin et al., 2025). This suggests that when AI tools are properly designed, they don't just teach content—they can actually increase motivation.

## The

 Critical Question: Is This AI Tool Designed for Learning or Convenience?

At BookBot, we study how AI can support reading development without creating dependency. The research makes clear that not all AI learning apps for kids are created equal. Here's what separates helpful AI tutoring for students from harmful ones:

**Design matters enormously.** The Harvard study's AI tutor was built on decades of physics education research. It didn't just give answers—it guided students through problem-solving steps, asked clarifying questions, and provided feedback that promoted understanding. In contrast, the AI feedback coach in Hansen's study gave real-time prompts that students followed blindly, leading to overreliance (Hansen et al., 2025).

**Long-term use reveals problems.** Research on AI tools in extended interventions (lasting a full semester or year) found that effectiveness drops to nearly zero over time. The initial novelty wears off, and students lose motivation (Frontiers in Psychology, 2025). This suggests that even good AI tools shouldn't be used as a permanent replacement for human instruction—they work best as targeted supplements.

**Hybrid approaches work best.** Multiple studies show that combining AI feedback with human guidance produces better results than either alone. Students receiving both AI and teacher feedback scored significantly higher than those receiving only one type (Lo et al., 2025). One study found that when human supervision was paired with AI tutoring, students successfully solved problems 66.2% of the time, compared to 60.7% with human tutors alone.

## Practical Strategies: How to Use AI Tools Wisely

Here's what the research suggests for parents and teachers navigating educational technology with children:

**Use AI for scaffolding, not shortcuts.** Encourage your child to use AI tools to check their understanding after they've attempted work independently. Instead of "What's the answer?", teach them to ask, "Is my thinking correct?" or "What am I missing?" This keeps them doing the cognitive work while getting useful feedback.

**Choose tools designed for learning, not just answering questions.** Look for AI tutoring for students that asks questions back, provides hints rather than answers, and explains why—not just what. Avoid tools that simply give completed homework or essays. At BookBot, this principle guides our design: the AI helps children decode challenging words and provides encouragement, but children still do the reading themselves.

**Set boundaries on AI use.** Based on the research showing cognitive decline from overreliance (Zhai et al., 2024), consider establishing clear rules: AI can be a homework helper, but shouldn't be the primary teacher. Think of it like a calculator—useful for checking work, but students still need to learn the underlying math.

**Watch for signs of overreliance.** If your child reaches for AI before attempting work themselves, or can't complete assignments without it, they may be developing unhealthy dependence. The Hansen study showed students prioritizing AI validation over their own judgment—a red flag (Hansen et al., 2025).

**Prioritize AI tools with human oversight.** Research consistently shows that supervised AI use outperforms unsupervised use. If your child's school uses AI tutoring programs, the ones with teacher monitoring and intervention produce the best outcomes.

**Recognize AI won't maintain effectiveness indefinitely.** Don't expect an AI tool that works great initially to stay effective long-term. Plan to rotate tools, combine them with other approaches, and regularly assess whether they're still benefiting your child's learning.

## The Bottom Line: AI Can Help, But Only If Used Thoughtfully

The research paints a nuanced picture. AI in education has genuine potential—the Harvard study's students learned twice as much in less time, and felt more engaged doing it (Kestin et al., 2025). But those same technologies can backfire spectacularly when misused, leading to worse critical thinking and overreliance on external validation (Hansen et al., 2025; Zhai et al., 2024).

Should your child use AI for homework? The answer is: sometimes, with guardrails. AI works best when it supports your child's thinking rather than replacing it, when it's designed specifically for learning rather than convenience, and when human guidance remains central.

At BookBot and Flinders University, we're researching exactly these questions—how can AI enhance reading development without creating dependency? How do we design tools that genuinely support learning? The evidence so far suggests that thoughtful, limited, well-designed AI use can benefit students. But more isn't better, and the wrong tools used the wrong way can genuinely harm learning.
