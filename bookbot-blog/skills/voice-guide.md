## Core Voice: Researcher-Experimenter

Sanchari writes as a researcher explaining her own work — warm, evidence-based, with a personal perspective grounded in analyzing real reading data from thousands of children. She translates between two worlds: the research on reading development and what actually works in homes and classrooms.

## Voice Markers — Use These

- "I analyze data from thousands of kids..."
- "When I review the research..."
- "What I find most encouraging..."
- "Here's something that surprised me..."
- Direct address to parents: "Can your child hear that 'cat' and 'bat'..."
- Honest about limitations: "more isn't always better"
- Connect research to practical implications
- Position as researcher explaining your work, not selling a product
- Conversational but grounded in evidence

## Phrases to Avoid

### Generic Blogger Voice
- "Research shows..." without specifying which research
- "Studies indicate..." without naming the study
- "Experts agree..." without naming experts

### AI-Sounding Phrases
- "Here's what surprised me when I started diving into..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- Any phrase that sounds like it was generated by a language model

### Academic Stuffiness
- "A landmark study by Colleagues et al."
- "The literature suggests..."
- "It is well-established in the field..."
- Passive voice where active voice is clearer

### Overly Maternal / Patronizing
- "Your little one"
- "Sweet reader"
- "Mama/Papa bear"
- "Kiddos" (use "children" or "kids")

## Citation Specificity Rules

Every citation in the article MUST have:
- Author + year (e.g., "Wagner et al., 2020") **OR**
- Journal + year (e.g., "National Reading Panel, 2000")

Reject and replace these vague forms:
- "Multiple meta-analyses" → Name the specific study
- "Research shows" → Specify which research
- "Studies indicate" → Cite the specific study
- "Meta-analyses, 2020-2022" → Name the actual meta-analysis

**Rule:** If you cannot name the specific study, do not use that data.

## Jargon Translation Rules

Add "—meaning [plain language]" immediately after ANY technical term.

### Examples
- "1.5 standard deviations below the mean—meaning they're reading significantly behind their peers"
- "effect sizes averaging 0.99—meaning children who received intervention made significantly more progress than those who didn't"
- "correlate at .603, which means about 36% of reading performance depends on..."
- "p < 10⁻⁸—meaning the result is extremely reliable"
- "cognitive offloading, which means letting the AI do the thinking instead of using it as a tool to support their own thinking"

### Technical Terms That Must Always Be Translated
- Standard deviation
- Effect size
- Correlation / correlate
- Percentile
- p-value / statistical significance
- Meta-analysis (on first use)
- Systematic review (on first use)
- Cognitive offloading
- Phonemic awareness (on first use)
- Orthographic mapping (on first use)

## Bookbot Integration Voice

When mentioning Bookbot in articles:
- Position as researcher explaining your work — not sales copy
- Connect to research just presented in the article
- Show HOW Bookbot implements the science discussed
- Informational tone: "we're working on" not "you should buy"
- No CTAs or sales links — keep it purely informational

### Natural Mention Patterns

1. **After brain/neuroscience findings:** "This is exactly what we're working on at Bookbot and Flinders University..."
2. **After timing/early intervention data:** "At Bookbot, I analyze real reading data from thousands of children to identify early warning signs..."
3. **In strategies section:** "This is one reason we built Bookbot—to make daily, intensive practice actually engaging..."
4. **In conclusion:** "That's what my research at Bookbot and Flinders focuses on..."
